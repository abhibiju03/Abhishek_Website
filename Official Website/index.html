					<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
					Hey, thank you so much for dropping by my website! Here's a little bit about me!
					<br><br>
					Being an NRI throughout my childhood, and having been exposed to two starkly contrasting yet amalgamating cultures, I have experienced the best of both worlds. It's been a fulfilling experience,  and I am grateful for having been gifted this wonderful existence. Sounds very cliche, I know, but these experiences define my very core and personality, and it's been a wild ride, to say the least!
					<br><br>
					A 17 year-old on the path of achieving fulfilment,experiencing joy, creating impact and above all attaining
					<span id="dots">...</span>
					
					<span id="more">
					mental clarity.
					<br><br>
					I presently study at the JSS Private School in Dubai, UAE and I hold the position of the President of the MUN Committee there. I have a diverse array of interests and passions which I consistently work towards. I enjoy playing music, coding (usually) webpages, playing Minecraft, playing a game of Cricket or Basketball, Reading etc. I also love studying political ideologies (trust me, it is more interesting than it sounds!). Most of these, I have picked up overtime, and many of them have popped up only in last couple of years. Besides all this, it goes without saying that I deeply enjoy the company of friends and family and I'm lucky to have been blessed with amazing ones!
					<br><br>
					That's about it from me, If you would like to know anything more, or just chat with me, hit me up on Instagram or send me a Mail!
					<br><br>
					Cheers!

					<h1 class="center">Music</h1>
					<p>I picked up guitar two years ago, and I absolutely love playing it as it became more than just a hobby. Check out some of my work over at Instagram!</p>

					<h1 class="center">Writing</h1>
					<p>Writing short stories and poems is such a beautiful experience, being capabe of trasmitting oceans worth of message across in space a water pudle occupies. A spectacular analogy and food for thought!</p>

				<div class="col-md-3 text-center desktop">

					<h1 class="center">Web Development</h1>
					<p>This website, is my first hand-coded fully fledged project and the process of creating it has been absolutely phenomenal. Front end development, is such a beautiful component of the digital world. I am ecstatic to gain more knowledge on this topic and start working on more projects.</p>

					<h1 class="center">Public Speaking</h1>
					<p>Being an extrovert, I have always been one with the podium. I cherish debating, anchoring, delegating and things of the sort. It gives me an emotional rush and immense joy, which love!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3 text-center">

						<img src="img/baking.png">
					</div>
					<h1 class="center">Gaming</h1>
					<p>Now before you get the wrong idea, I am not your typical gamer, who plays CoD or Fortnite for hours on end. I'm more like Minecraft, a totally different experience of gameplay. I relish the freedom the game grants you, with countless colour palettes, it's own electrical circuits. I think that my choice of game reflects quite well who I am as a person.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3 text-center">
					<div class="icon size">
						<img src="img/socializing.png">
					</div>
					<h1 class="center">Socializing</h1>
					<p>I've already told this enough, but I love meeting new people, interacting with them and expressing ideas. It is genuinely true that sharing experiences and memories and the simple act of communicating is an eternal gift that keeps on giving.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-3 text-center">
					<div class="icon size">
						<img src="img/cubing.png">
					</div>
					<h1 class="center">Cubing</h1>
					<p>It has been about six years since I learned how to cube, which essentially refers to solving a Rubik's Cube. It is still really fascinating and satisfying how some material object can organize itself to make sense out of nothing. It's a literal representation of creating 'order out of chaos'. </p>

				<div class="col-md-3 text-center">

					<h1 class="center">Productivity</h1>
					<p>The fact that we have control over, how much we can accomplish inour limited time is fascinating. Being busy and productive are not the same thing. These are just some of the insights I had while delving into this topic. Trust me, there's so much you can gain from this!</p>

				<h1>PURSUITS</h1>
				<div class="pursuits-content">
					<p>Hey, glad to know that youâ€™re still here.<br><br>    
					This section is written pretty freestyle and as to what you can expect in this section, it is really what it sounds like. This section has been labelled pursuits as it involves things I am currently striving to master, and it is quite diverse in its outlook. These consist of specific activities or habits I garnered interest in while listening to various influencers, public figures or prodigies.<br><br>   
					The first of these is a morning routine. I am a firm believer, not necessarily in the fact that the early bird gets the worm, but rather in the statement that if you conquer your morning, you conquer your day. And hence I have been experimenting. All of our bodies are programmed differently and without experimenting routines there is no real way to determine the activities that comprise a personally tailored one. Join me on this journey if you desire by putting some thought into designing your own! Try it out :)<br><br>  
					As is evident from the previous paragraph, I am a bit off a productivity nerd. This is not necessarily concerned with high performance in one key area, but rather a wholesome polished quality of life, characterized by the achievement of your most ambitious goals. In no way is my productivity ideal, and the fact is it never can be. But I have always been obsessed with the idea of doing as much as you can in your limited time here. 
					<br><br>  
					That is about it for now, but I will update this list as when I pick up new interests<br><br>  
					Cheers :)
